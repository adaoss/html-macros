# HTML Macros

These are the macros that I use in many of the projects that I work on. 
I use the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) naming convention for classes and other stuff. Also, many of these macros will only work on my projects. 
Feel free to fork and use it as you wish.

## Instalation
```
composer require oliveira/html-macros
```
And:
```
composer dump -o
```
